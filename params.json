  "body": "## Welcome to Geoss2Go\r\n\r\n![Geoss2Go logo](myimages/ic_launcher.png)\r\n\r\n**Geoss2Go** is a mobile application for Android that bases on [Geopaparazzi](http://www.geopaparazzi.eu) and configures  its use in specific sectors. **Geopaparazzi** is a mobile application for digital field mapping developed and maintained by HydroloGIS since 2005 with over 10000 users spread all over the world. \r\n\r\nThrough Geoss2Go a user can configure Geopaparazzi for the use of particular kind of data or mapping specific objects based on a personalized form. Geoss2Go sets and configures a Geopaparazzi environment or project ready to be used for a specific purpose (tourism, agriculture, risk management). \r\n\r\nGeoss2Go establishes the connections and defines the parameters for the visualization of the layers that the provider of the application considers useful for the current survey depending on the **type, argument and purpose of the survey** i.e. the layers available to be shown in case of an agriculture application will be different from those available in case of risk management. The user can choose what to visualize and the definition of such a **profile** will **personalize** Geopaparazzi with the maps, forms and project specific for the current field survey.\r\n\r\nPractically it will be possible to have several profiles on the phone each one activating a predefined set of parameters and connections for the main application Geopaparazzi. Additionally, Geopaparazzi will be used in the default way if none of these profiles is activated. \r\n\r\n## Geopaparazzi\r\n\r\nTo unleash the power of this app you need to install also the digital field mapping app Geopaparazzi.
